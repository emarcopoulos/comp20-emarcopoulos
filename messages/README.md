Can a data request be made to a different origin or from your local machine?
-No it cannot be, as evidenced by the fact that when either were tried an
 error showed up in the console that said one cannot access data of a 
 different origin. Basically, a domain can only retrieve data from that same
 domain, preventing a script in a malicious domain from meddling with data
 from another domain.

Some of this code was written by the course staff.
